## Description and rationale of the project

For this project, we are trying to create our own simplified version of a
Virtual Private Network (VPN), where a host can send and receive messages
to different hosts. So whenever Host A sends a message, the packet is
sent to the VPN server and the VPN server sends the message to the
destination, and the message received goes to the VPN server and then
to Host A. The ultimate goal is for us to use it for personal uses in
our daily lives!

## Specific goals and targets in the project

- Fragmentation (must)
- Encapsulation (must)
- Proxy server (must)
- Authentication (nice to have)
- Encryption (may use third-party code)

## Tentative timeline with clear goals and targets

(Timeline is flexible depending on roadblocks)

- Due Sat Nov 11: Research and design
- Due Sat Nov 18: fragmentation & proxy server ← all code goes here
- Due Sat Nov 25: Encapsulation & Encryption
- Due Sat Dec 2 : Maybe authentication (if we have time…)
- Due Mon Dec 4: Film video

## How the project relates to the field of “Computer Networks”

Virtual Private Network (VPN) is a critical technology that
fortifies internet privacy and security by creating an encrypted
connection over unsecured networks. Through IPsec
(Internet Protocol Security) protocol, it establishes a secure
"tunnel" for data transmission, safeguarding user identities and
information from cyber threats.

The VPN project relates closely to our Computer Networks course,
applying key topics like encryption, tunneling, and security
protocols covered in our lectures. It demonstrates how VPNs ensure
secure, remote network access and overcome geographic restrictions,
making it a practical extension of our coursework.
