GOAL
  Create a simple VPN application that can send and receive packets
  over the internet. It directs all traffic to the VPN interface.

  where: 
    1. Create a virtual network interface that directs all traffic to tun0 (the
       VPN interface)
    2. Client connects to tun0 and `listens` to the requests from tun0
       interface
    3. Client sends the requests to the VPN server through socket connection
       which is encrypted by openssl. Need to encapsulation the packet using
       protocols such as GRE, PPTP and L2F. Decided to use GRE.
    4. VPN server receives the requests and sends them to the target servers
    5. Target server sends the response to the VPN server 
    6. VPN server encrypts the response and sends it back to the client through
       socket connection with openssl
    7. Client receives the response and sends it to tun0 interface 

  Two VMs can be run on different machines.
    


ALL QUESTIONS ASKED IN THE PROJECT

  1. What entity is responsible for creating the packets?
  2. How does the client get the packets from tun0 interface?
