Motivation


Goal
  Client and server program
  Have them connected
  Server prints out packets/payload/whatever that client sends.
  Set up IP/Ethernet header according to RFC


The followig is the structure of the program
============================================


protocol 
    This file contains all header structs and emun.
    sliding window protocol
	
utils
	cksum
	verify_cksum

debug 
  contains debug macros and debugging print functions

client
	Wrap payload in a header
    encrytion
    send to server

encrytion
    generate key
    encrypt payload
	

filter (optional)
  filter out packets that are not from client

auth (optional)
  use a third party server to authanticate Client
  the main idea is
    generate a key based on client machine's mac address
    and send it to the server
    server will generate a key based on client's mac address

server
  authanticate client (optional)
    filter out packets that are not from client
  decrypt
    verify_cksum
    print payload
    send ack to client
    
    replace the header with server's address and mac address
    forward to correct destination 

MAKEFILE
  Enable all warnings flag
  compile client and server 






Coding principle
  Do not use magic numbers -> just use define
  Use snake case
  One function should only do one things
  Each function should have no more than 60 lines of code.
  NO nested #ifdefine but #define is ok
  No function pointers
  No goto/jumps,..
  Ensure code is modularized
